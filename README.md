## Introduction

In response to frequent customer complaints posted on social media platforms, our store has taken a proactive approach to mitigate dissatisfaction. To address this issue, we have devised a campaign aimed at reaching out to customers who are more likely to complain, with the intention of gathering their valuable feedback on improving our services.

To identify these customers, we will leverage their transaction history from the last 30 days and develop a machine learning model using Python. This model will predict whether a customer is likely to file a complaint by the end of the month or not. By utilizing historical transaction data, we aim to proactively engage with customers who are more prone to expressing their concerns, enabling us to address any issues and enhance their overall experience.

Through the application of machine learning techniques, we anticipate gaining valuable insights that will facilitate targeted communication and support our ongoing efforts to provide exceptional customer service.

## The Plan

1. Load our dataset
2. Data Expolaration
3. Data pre-processing
4. Machine Learning
   1. Random Forest
   2. Gradient Boost
5. Conclusion


## How to run the project
1.   You need to install Python, I have used version 3.9
2.   You need to install dependencies, use this command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.   The open Jupyter Notebook on app folder, app.ipynb - this notebook has covered everything
