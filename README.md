## Introduction

The aim of this analysis is to investigate a credit dataset containing information on clients' loan details. The dataset comprises columns with borrowers' information such as age, gender, salary status, and transaction details, while the remaining columns contain loan-related information, including loan amount, interest/fee, tenure month, and loan status.

In addition to analyzing the dataset, we will also build a predictive model to determine whether the client will default or not based on the provided information.

## Tasks
 

1.   Give different explanatory analysis on those variables and clearly give us the insights from that analysis.
2.   Create a supervised model (from any algorithm of your choice) and show us how you can predict if the target variable “is default”
3.   Show us all model performance evaluation.


## How to run the project
1.   You need to install Python, I have used version 3.9
2.   You need to install dependencies, use this command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.   The open Jupyter Notebook on app folder, app.ipynb - this notebook has covered everything
